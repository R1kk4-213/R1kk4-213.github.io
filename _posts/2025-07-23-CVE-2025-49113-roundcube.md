## Introduction

In this post, I’ll begin my journey into CVE analysis by taking a closer look at CVE-2025-49113, a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Roundcube. Since this is my first time analyzing a CVE, my primary goal is to learn how to debug and understand a real-world vulnerability step by step. I’ll break down the process—from setting up the environment and reproducing the issue, to tracing the vulnerable code and understanding how the deserialization flaw leads to code execution. This hands-on approach will help me build a solid foundation for future vulnerability research.
